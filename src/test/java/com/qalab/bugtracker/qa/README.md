This folder contains the test automation infrastructure for the BugTracker project.

## Folder Structure

- `tests/` â€” Contains integration and functional tests.
- `config/` â€” Configuration files or dynamic test setup hooks.
- `utils/` â€” Shared utilities or helper methods for testing.

## Vision

Our QA approach combines:

- REST API testing with either MockMvc or RestAssured
- Flyway-controlled DB state setup
- CI-ready, Dockerized test pipelines
